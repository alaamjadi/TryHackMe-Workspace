# Vulnerability Scanner Overview

This document explains what vulnerabilities are, how vulnerability scanning works, the main scan types, common scanning tools, and how vulnerabilities are identified, scored, and practically assessed using OpenVAS.

### What Are Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software, hardware, or configurations that attackers can exploit to compromise systems or networks. If left unpatched, vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, service disruption, or full system compromise.

**Patching** is the process of fixing vulnerabilities by applying updates or configuration changes.

### Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the automated inspection of systems and networks to identify known weaknesses. Regular scanning is essential for reducing risk and meeting compliance requirements.

Automated scanners improve efficiency by identifying vulnerabilities at scale and generating structured reports.

### Types of Vulnerability Scans

Vulnerability scans are categorized based on access level and scan location.

#### Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans

| Scan type             | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authenticated scans   | Require host credentials and provide deep visibility into system configuration and installed software           |
| Unauthenticated scans | Do not require credentials, it is resource-intensive and identify vulnerabilities exposed to external attackers |

Authenticated scans are commonly used internally, while unauthenticated scans are often used for public-facing assets.

#### Internal vs External Scans

| Scan type      | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal scans | Performed from within the network to identify post-breach attack paths      |
| External scans | Performed from outside the network to identify perimeter-exposed weaknesses |

### Tools for Vulnerability Scanning

Several tools are commonly used for automated vulnerability assessment.

| Tool                                                | Characteristics                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)   | Enterprise-grade scanner, proprietary, on-premises deployment    |
| [Qualys](https://qualys.com/)                       | Cloud-based vulnerability management and compliance platform     |
| [Nexpose](https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/) | Asset discovery, risk scoring, hybrid deployment by Rapid7       |
| [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/)                 | Open-source scanner suitable for small environments and learning |

### CVE and CVSS

Vulnerabilities are identified and prioritized using standardized systems.

#### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a unique identifier assigned to each publicly known vulnerability maintained by MITRE corporation. (Example: CVE-2026-0583)

| CVE component | Description                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| CVE prefix    | Identifies the entry as a CVE   |
| Year          | Year of discovery               |
| Numeric ID    | Unique vulnerability identifier |

#### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

CVSS assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities based on impact and exploitability. CVSS scores help prioritize remediation efforts.

| CVSS range | Severity |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 0.0–3.9    | Low      |
| 4.0–6.9    | Medium   |
| 7.0–8.9    | High     |
| 9.0–10     | Critical |

### OpenVAS Overview

OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanner developed by Greenbone Security. It detects known vulnerabilities using a regularly updated database and provides detailed scan reports.

OpenVAS is commonly used for learning, small environments, and baseline assessments.

### OpenVAS Installation (Docker-Based)

OpenVAS can be installed using Docker to simplify dependency management.

#### Installation Commands

| Purpose                | Command                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install Docker         | `sudo apt install docker.io`                                   |
| Run OpenVAS container  | `sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas immauss/openvas` |
| Start Docker container | `docker start openvas`                                         |

### Accessing OpenVAS

| Step             | Action            |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Web access       | https://127.0.0.1 |
| Default username | admin             |
| Default password | admin             |

### Performing a Vulnerability Scan with OpenVAS

Vulnerability scans are executed through tasks created in the OpenVAS dashboard.

#### Scan Workflow

| Step             | Description                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Create task      | Define scan name and target       |
| Configure target | Specify IP address                |
| Select scan type | Choose scan profile               |
