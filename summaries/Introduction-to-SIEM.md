# Introduction to SIEM

This document explains why centralized log management is essential in modern networks and how SIEM enables effective detection, correlation, and investigation of security events.

### What Is SIEM?

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a centralized security solution used by SOC analysts to:

- Collect logs from multiple sources
- Normalize and parse logs into a consistent format
- Correlate events across systems
- Detect suspicious or malicious activity
- Generate alerts for investigation

SIEM acts as the core visibility and detection platform in a Security Operations Center.

### Logs Everywhere, Answers Nowhere

Modern networks contain many interconnected systems that constantly generate logs. While logs exist everywhere, meaningful answers are difficult to obtain without centralization and correlation.

### Log Source Categories

Log sources are generally divided into two main categories.

| Log source type | Description                             | Examples                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Host-centric    | Logs generated by endpoints and servers | User authentication, file access, process execution, registry changes, PowerShell activity |
| Network-centric | Logs generated by network devices       | Firewall traffic, VPN access, SSH connections, web traffic, file transfers                 |

Together, these sources generate massive volumes of logs continuously.

### Challenges of Isolated Logs

| Challenge            | Explanation                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Numerous log sources | Hundreds of events per second across many devices |
| No centralization    | Analysts must manually access each system         |
| Limited context      | Individual logs do not reveal attack chains       |
| Limited analysis     | Manual review cannot scale                        |
| Format differences   | Logs vary by OS, device, and application          |

Without correlation, suspicious activity often appears harmless.

### Why SIEM Is Needed

SIEM solves the limitations of isolated logs by centralizing, standardizing, and correlating data to detect threats efficiently.

### Core Features of SIEM

| Feature                    | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Centralized log collection | Aggregates logs from endpoints, servers, firewalls, and applications |
| Normalization              | Converts different log formats into a consistent structure           |
| Parsing                    | Breaks raw logs into meaningful fields                               |
| Correlation                | Links related events across multiple sources                         |
| Real-time alerting         | Triggers alerts based on detection rules                             |
| Dashboards and reporting   | Visualizes security posture and activity                             |

### Log Normalization and Correlation

Normalization ensures logs share common fields regardless of origin. Correlation analyzes relationships between events.

Example correlated activity:

- VPN login from a new IP
- File access on a shared drive
- PowerShell execution
- Outbound network connection

Individually normal events can collectively indicate credential compromise and data exfiltration.

### SIEM Dashboards

Dashboards provide summarized and actionable insights.

| Common dashboard elements |
| ------------------------- |
| Alert highlights          |
| Failed login attempts     |
| Events ingested count     |
| Rules triggered           |
| System health alerts      |
| Top domains visited       |

Dashboards are the primary interface for SOC analysts.

### Log Sources and Visibility

SIEM ingests logs from multiple platforms to provide end-to-end visibility.

### Common Log Sources

| Platform    | Log characteristics                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows     | Event IDs, authentication, system and security events |
| Linux       | Authentication, kernel, cron, web and service logs    |
| Web servers | HTTP requests, responses, status codes                |

### Common Linux Log Locations

| Path              | Purpose                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| /var/log/httpd    | Web server requests and errors |
| /var/log/apache   | Apache access and error logs   |
| /var/log/auth.log | Authentication activity        |
| /var/log/secure   | Security-related events        |
| /var/log/cron     | Scheduled task execution       |
| /var/log/kern     | Kernel events                  |

### Log Ingestion Methods

| Method            | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent / forwarder | Lightweight software installed on endpoints        |
| Syslog            | Real-time log forwarding using a standard protocol |
| Manual upload     | Ingesting offline log files                        |
| Port forwarding   | Sending logs directly to a listening SIEM port     |

Different SIEM platforms support multiple ingestion methods.

### Detection Rules and Alerting

SIEM detects threats using logical detection rules applied to normalized log fields.

### Detection Rule Examples

| Scenario           | Rule logic                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Brute-force login  | Multiple failed logins within a short time window |
| Suspicious success | Successful login after multiple failures          |
| USB monitoring     | Alert on USB insertion                            |
| Data exfiltration  | Outbound traffic exceeding a defined threshold    |

### Rule Creation Using Event Fields

Detection rules rely on specific field-value pairs. For example:

| Use case          | Rule logic                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Log clearing      | If LogSource = WinEventLog and EventID = 104         |
| Command execution | If EventID = 4688 and NewProcessName contains whoami |

Normalization is essential so rules work consistently across log sources.

### Alert Investigation Workflow

| Step            | Action                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Alert review    | Examine events tied to the alert                  |
| Rule validation | Confirm conditions that triggered the alert       |
| Classification  | Determine true positive or false positive         |
| Response        | Investigate, isolate host, block IP, notify owner |
| Improvement     | Tune rules to reduce false positives              |

SOC analysts spend most of their time validating and responding to alerts.
