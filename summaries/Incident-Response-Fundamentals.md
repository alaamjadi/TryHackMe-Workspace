## Incident Response Fundamentals – Summary & Cheat Sheet

### 1. What Is Incident Response?

**Incident Response (IR)** is the structured approach used by organizations to:

- Prepare for security incidents
- Detect and analyze malicious activity
- Contain, eradicate, and recover from attacks
- Learn from incidents to improve future defenses

An **incident** begins when a **true positive alert** confirms malicious activity that poses risk to systems, data, or availability.

### 2. Events, Alerts, and Incidents

#### Key Definitions

- **Event**: Any action performed by a system or process (logged activity)
- **Alert**: Trigger generated by a security tool after detecting suspicious activity
- **Incident**: A confirmed **true positive** alert representing real harm

#### Alert Classification

| Type           | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| False Positive | Benign activity incorrectly flagged as malicious |
| True Positive  | Confirmed malicious activity                     |

#### Incident Severity Levels

- **Low**
- **Medium**
- **High**
- **Critical** (highest priority)

Severity is based on **impact**, not just type.

### 3. Common Types of Security Incidents

#### 1. Malware Infections

- Malicious software damaging systems or networks
- Often delivered via email attachments or downloads

#### 2. Security Breaches

- Unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive data
- High business and legal impact

#### 3. Data Leaks

- Exposure of confidential data
- Can be malicious or accidental (misconfiguration, human error)

#### 4. Insider Attacks

- Malicious activity originating from within the organization
- Dangerous due to existing access privileges

#### 5. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

- Overloading systems with requests
- Impacts **availability**, one of the CIA triad pillars
- Impact varies by organization — the same incident can be minor for one and catastrophic for another.

### 4. Incident Response Frameworks

Two widely used frameworks:

- **SANS**
- **NIST**

#### 4.1 SANS Incident Response Framework

Mnemonic: **PICERL**

| Phase           | Description                             |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Preparation     | Build teams, plans, tools, and training |
| Identification  | Detect and confirm incidents            |
| Containment     | Limit spread and damage                 |
| Eradication     | Remove the root cause                   |
| Recovery        | Restore systems and operations          |
| Lessons Learned | Improve processes and defenses          |

#### 4.2 NIST Incident Response Framework

| Phase                                  | Description                        |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Preparation                            | Readiness and planning             |
| Detection and Analysis                 | Identify and investigate incidents |
| Containment, Eradication, and Recovery | Stop, remove, and restore          |
| Post-Incident Activity                 | Review and improve                 |

#### 4.3 SANS vs NIST Mapping

| SANS            | NIST                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Preparation     | Preparation                            |
| Identification  | Detection and Analysis                 |
| Containment     | Containment, Eradication, and Recovery |
| Eradication     | Containment, Eradication, and Recovery |
| Recovery        | Containment, Eradication, and Recovery |
| Lessons Learned | Post-Incident Activity                 |

### 5. Incident Response Plan (IRP)

A **formal, management-approved document** that defines how incidents are handled.

#### Core Components

- Roles and responsibilities
- Incident response methodology
- Communication plan (internal & external)
- Escalation procedures
- Legal and law enforcement coordination

### 6. Incident Detection & Response Tools

#### Key Security Solutions

| Tool               | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SIEM**           | Centralized log collection and correlation                |
| **AV (Antivirus)** | Detects known malware                                     |
| **EDR**            | Advanced endpoint detection, containment, and remediation |

Some tools can **automate containment and eradication** actions.

### 7. Playbooks vs Runbooks

#### Playbooks

- High-level **guidelines**
- Incident-specific response flows
- Focus on _what_ to do

**Example: Phishing Email Playbook**

1. Notify stakeholders
2. Analyze email headers and content
3. Inspect attachments
4. Identify affected users
5. Isolate infected systems
6. Block sender

#### Runbooks

- Detailed **step-by-step execution**
- Tool- and environment-specific
- Focus on _how_ to do it

### 8. Key Takeaways (Quick Review)

- Not every alert is an incident
- Severity drives response priority
- Structured frameworks reduce chaos
- Preparation is as critical as response
- Documentation and lessons learned improve maturity
- Playbooks save time during high-pressure incidents
