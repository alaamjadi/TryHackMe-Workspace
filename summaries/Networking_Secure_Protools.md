# Networking: Secure Protocols

This summary covers the essential concepts of network security protocols, focusing on protecting data during transit.

### 1. Core Security Principles

Secure protocols are designed to address three primary security goals:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot read the data, protecting sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
- **Integrity**: Guaranteeing that data cannot be altered by an adversary while in transit.
- **Authenticity**: Verifying that the communication is occurring with the genuine intended server rather than a fraudulent one.

### 2. Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS is a security layer integrated into standard protocols to provide encryption and protection. When applied, the protocol name typically appends an "**S**" to signify it is secure.

| Original Protocol | Secure Version | Typical Port Change   |
| :---------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| **HTTP**          | **HTTPS**      | 80 $\rightarrow$ 443  |
| **POP3**          | **POP3S**      | 110 $\rightarrow$ 995 |
| **SMTP**          | **SMTPS**      | 25 $\rightarrow$ 465  |
| **IMAP**          | **IMAPS**      | 143 $\rightarrow$ 993 |

### 3. Secure Remote Access: SSH

While **Telnet** allows for remote terminal connections, it is considered insecure because it transmits data in plain text. **SSH (Secure Shell)** serves as the secure alternative.

- **Function**: Provides an encrypted channel for remote administration and command execution.
- **Default Port**: TCP Port 22.

### 4. Analyzing Encrypted Traffic (Wireshark)

Because TLS encrypts application data, standard packet captures cannot be read without the session keys. To decrypt HTTPS traffic in Wireshark for analysis, follow these steps:

1.  **Generate SSL Keys**: Launch a browser (like Chromium) with a flag to log keys: `chromium --ssl-key-log-file=~/ssl-key.log`.
2.  **Configure Wireshark**:
    - Right-click a packet and select **Protocol Preferences**.
    - Navigate to **Transport Layer Security** $\rightarrow$ **Open Transport Layer Security preferences**.
    - Click **Browse** to select the `ssl-key.log` file generated by the browser.
3.  **Result**: Wireshark will use the log file to decrypt the traffic, making sensitive information (like login credentials) visible in the packet details.
